# wonderwall
A Simulated Trading Web Application built using ReactJS.

This will serve as the front-end for this application.

This user-interface will have orders tab, holdings tab, funds tab, etc.
It will also have a side ticker and marketwatch to place trade orders
I plan to use the highcharts api for displaying candlestick charts at a later point in time.
